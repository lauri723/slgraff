Hi Steve!!!

Very nice to meet you!

So appreciate the assistance. I'll make the changes and try, again.

I'm really new to coding though it's something I've wanted to do for many, many, many years. Finally found myself in a position to do so, using online courses. I think I'm doing OK, for an "old person", but need far more study and experience. Today I learned how to communicate within GitHub.

May I contact you when I really get into a jam? I'm very stubborn, and nothing if not persistent, so only ask for help after I've exhausted all other resources. It would be great to know someone is out there, even if I never need to partake. Or just a quick "Hello World" is always good, too.

BTW, I see you're from Durham, NC. I'm just down the road in Greensboro (transplant from Los Angeles area). Very exciting to connect with someone so nearby.

Again, thank you very much,
Lauri
